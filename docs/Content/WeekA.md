# Week 1
Go through my [Getting Started](https://jor-donegal.github.io/GettingStarted26/) notes before doing anything else. These notes are the same for each module, so if you have gone through these on one of my previous modules, all good. There are no deliverables for this, it is not graded.

So for this week, just some (light!) reading.

## Actions

1. This week I need you to read through some [fundamentals of cloud computing](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/fundamentals), to deobfuscate and define some of the terminology we are going to use.

2. You may not have covered Computer Arcitecture at undergraduate level. Read through these basic notes on [CPU hardware](https://jor-donegal.github.io/CPU101/).
