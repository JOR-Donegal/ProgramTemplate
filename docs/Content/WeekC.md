# Week 3
This week  we need to look at all those components which we need to make a small, enterprise data centre. When I started building computer rooms and data centres in the late 1980s, they were based on minicomputer/mainframe type technology. In many ways, they were far simpler and smaller than a modern data centre. However, many of the characteristics were those we can still find in a modern data centre. In this week's theory, I want to cover some of the basic technical areas with which we need familiarity. These concepts scale up, we can apply them to large data centres and even to cloud-scale data centres.

I assumme you are already competent with VMWare Workstation, if not, bring this to the attention of your lecturer now.

We need to examine the desktop hypervisor which ships with Windows, Hyper-V. Do NOT install this on your host computer, we will use it in a VM only as nested virtualization.

## Actions
1. Read through my notes on [data centre design considerations and layout](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/data-centres-1/)
2. Go through the exercises in my [notes on Hyper V](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/desktop-virtualization-in-hyper-v-1/).
