# Week 2
I want you to methodically verify your system in some technical detail to assess its suitability for desktop virtualization. Although you may have done the basics of this before, in these exercises we go into specifics.

We need an understanding of server hardware, even when we are using public cloud (and do not have access to the hardware). In this weeks theory reading, I go through aspects of hardware that are important to us. It is worthwhile to supplement this information by looking at some commercial server providers to see what new paradigms have arisen since I wrote these notes.

I also want to talk you through considerations when building an operating system, host, VM or device. In these notes, I am going to list some of the main things you need to do in every case, you are going to carry them out and verify! However, as with so many of my notes, this is guidance only. On a real project, find the best practice from the hardware vendor, the OS vendor, and the client, and create your own operating procedures to comply. In an Enterprise, what we will do here will only be the beginning. Security will be based on corporate policy and deployed centrally from a domain controller or similar. Discuss this with your lecturer. In any real enterprise or data centre, you as the technical person DO NOT MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT THESE THINGS!!!!

## Actions

1. [Dig into the hardware](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/verifying-your-system-1/) of your personal system in some detail. 

2. Do some more reading on [processors](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/server-hardware-1/), this time on topics relating to server specification.

3. Read through and understand my notes on [OS Configuration](https://johnoraw.gitbook.io/os-configuration/).
