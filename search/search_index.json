Welcome to this module, PROGRAMME. I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11. This iteration of the module was arranged for e-delivery for remote students. I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started. The major areas covered in weeks 2-11 are Topic 1 Topic 2 Topic 3 Topic 4 I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it. This module is intended for students who already have some background in scripting and automation, networking and operating systems. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. The content and structure of this module was created c. 2015 and last revised in 2022. It is updated annually. If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my Getting Started notes 1 to understand what you need. Copyright The content of these notes are (c) John ORaw 2026. I have tried to acknowledge and cite sources, if you think I have missed crediting someone else's work, please contact me by university e-mail and I will remedy. If you find errors in my notes or something has been superseded without me noticing, please let me know. The pace of technological development assures that my notes have a very short shelf life. They are intended to be a starting point for your studies, not the end point.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"This site contains basic notes in PROGRAMME.

Changing platforms has been the bane of my life. Moving my documents to an open format and to a technology that I can sync and save seems to be a good idea. And using a static site generator leaves me independent of any changes that come along to services in the future. After two years of experimentation, this is a new dedicated teaching account as of mid-2025. Retirement is hopefully not too far away! I want the notes to be available to my students after I retire, this is one way to do so.
